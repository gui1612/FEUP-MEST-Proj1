## Notes

- We started by pre-processing the given data with python (using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/)) and then we made the final pre-processing and data cleaning inside Rapid Minner
- Many of the pre-processing is repeated on both platforms for learning purposes, since the main goal of this project was to introduce us to the data science field
